      "The differences between withdrawing from a class and withdrawing from school are as follows: Withdrawing from a class: This means dropping a course from the student’s schedule after the close of registration for the term. Students who withdraw from a class will receive a “W” grade on their transcript, which does not affect their grade point average. However, withdrawing from a class may affect the student’s degree progress, financial aid, visa status, or full-time status. Students can withdraw from a class electronically through the OSCAR system until the deadline posted in the Official School Calendar. Withdrawing from school: This means leaving the Institute for the rest of the term and dropping all courses from the student’s schedule. Students who withdraw from school will receive “W” grades for all their courses, which do not affect their grade point average. However, withdrawing from school may have serious academic, financial, and personal implications. Students who withdraw from school must complete the electronic withdrawal process before the official deadline. Full-time graduate students who withdraw from school during a term are required to remain out of school in the following term as well, unless they file a petition to the faculty requesting a waiver of this requirement. Part-time graduate students who withdraw during a term are not required to remain out of school for an additional term.</s>\n"

However, withdrawing from a class may affect the student’s degree progress, financial aid, visa status, or full-time status. Students can withdraw from a class electronically through the OSCAR system until the deadline posted in the Official School Calendar. Withdrawing from school: This means leaving the Institute for the rest of the term and dropping all courses from the student’s schedule. Students who withdraw from school will receive “W” grades for all their courses, which do not affect their grade point average. However, withdrawing from school may have serious academic, financial, and personal implications. Students who withdraw from school must complete the electronic withdrawal process before the official deadline. Full-time graduate students who withdraw from school during a term are required to remain out of school in the following term as well, unless they file a petition to the faculty requesting a waiver of this requirement. Part-time graduate students who withdraw during a term are not required to remain out of school for an additional term.</s>\n",

The default number of credit hours for these courses is usually, so students must change the number of credits when they register. Many of these courses allow up to 21 hours in fall/spring and 16 hours in summer, and students who are working on research should register for the maximum load. A registration permit is required to register for some of these courses, such as ECE 7000, ECE 8900, ECE 8999, and ECE 8901/8902/8903.

      "<s>[INST]How many hours do I need to register for to be considered a full-time graduate student?[/INST] Full-time enrollment for graduate students is defined as a minimum of 12 hours, at least 9 of which must be on a letter grade and/or pass-fail basis. This status applies to international students, students on assistantships or fellowships, and active-duty military.</s>\n",
      "<s>[INST]What are the consequences of not registering during Phase I of registration?[/INST] If you do not register during Phase I, you may lose access to popular ECE classes, as they may be filled or cancelled by the time Phase II starts. You may also face registration restrictions or holds that could delay your registration.</s>\n",
      "<s>[INST]What is the difference between a major restriction and a permit required restriction?[/INST] A major restriction is a registration restriction that limits enrollment in a class to students in a specific major or majors. For example, ECE graduate level classes are restricted to ECE majors until the Monday of the second phase of registration. A permit required restriction is a registration restriction that requires permission from the instructor or the academic unit offering the class for any student to enroll in the class. For example, ECE 8999 (Search for a Research Topic and/or Advisor) is a permit-only class.</s>\n",
      "<s>[INST]How can a student register for a class that has a time conflict with another class?[/INST] A student can register for a class that has a time conflict with another class only if both instructors agree to accommodate the student in this situation. The student must obtain a time conflict form, which must be signed by the student and both instructors, and submit it to the Registrar’s Office to receive a permit to register for both classes.</s>\n",
      "<s>[INST]What is the maximum number of hours that a graduate student can register for in fall or spring semester?[/INST] The maximum number of hours that a graduate student can register for in fall or spring semester is 21. If a student attempts to register for more than 21 hours, they will receive a “MAXIMUM HOURS EXCEEDED” error message and must see the Registrar’s Office to request an exception.</s>\n"
